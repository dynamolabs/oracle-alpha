## 🎯 What Makes ORACLE Unique

### 1. Verifiable Track Record
Every signal is published on-chain with entry price. Performance is immutable and independently verifiable. No fake track records.

### 2. Multi-Source Confluence
We don't rely on a single signal. We aggregate 9 different sources and weight them by historical performance:
- Smart wallets (24 wallets, 5 elite tier)
- KOL tracking (31 influencers)
- Volume spike detection
- Narrative detection (AI, Meme, Political, etc.)
- News/trending aggregation
- Whale accumulation

### 3. Transparent Scoring
Our algorithm is open source. You can see exactly why a signal scored high or low:
- Base score from weighted sources
- Confluence bonuses
- Risk penalties
- Narrative matching

### 4. Real-Time Access
WebSocket support for instant notifications. ATH tracking updates every 5 minutes.

### 5. Composable
Other agents can integrate via API. Build your own trading bot on top of ORACLE signals.

### 6. Demo Mode
Built-in demo mode for presentations:
- `npm run demo` - Starts with realistic signal generation
- Seeds 30 historical signals with 60%+ win rate
- 4 signals per minute for live demos
- Perfect for video recording and presentations
